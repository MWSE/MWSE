# Flow Directions

!!! tip
	These values are available in Lua by their index in the `tes3.flowDirection` table. For example, `tes3.flowDirection.leftToRight` has a value of `"left_to_right"`.

Index       | Value
----------- | -----------------
leftToRight | `"left_to_right"`
topToBottom | `"top_to_bottom"`
