# About

The Morrowind Script Extender makes additional functions available for use in Morrowind scripts, beyond those provided by the game's construction set.

These extra functions allow modders to add features and behavior to scripts that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.

	If you are looking for MWSE scripting advice or discussions, try the [Morrowind Modding Community Discord](https://discord.gg/QDEBbaP).

## Installation

- Install the [Visual Studio x86 2022 Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) is required for MWSE. Note that you will need the x86 version, even if you already have the x64 redistributable installed.
- Install the [Morrowind Code Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510/) modifies the game executable, and MWSE assumes you have at least the base patches performed for its own modifications.
- Install the [Morrowind Graphic Extender XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) (MGE XE) allows MWSE to be loaded.
- Run MWSE-Update.exe in your Morrowind install folder. This was downloaded and installed as part of MGE XE's installation.
