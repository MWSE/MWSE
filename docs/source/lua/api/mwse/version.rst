mwse.version
====================================================================================================

`number`_. A numerical representation of the release version of MWSE currently being used.

Formatted as AAABBBCCC, where A is the major version, BBB is the minor version, and CCC is the patch version. BBB and CCC are forward-padded.

It is usually better to use mwse.buildDate instead.

.. _`number`: ../../lua/type/number.html
