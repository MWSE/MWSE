consumeMouseEvents
====================================================================================================

`boolean`_. When ``true``, mouse events over this element are sent to event handlers, or discarded if there is no handler. When ``false``, mouse events go upwards to the first ancestor that can consume mouse events. Useful to set on widget sub-elements. ``true`` by default.

.. _`boolean`: ../../../lua/type/boolean.html
