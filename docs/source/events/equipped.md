# equipped

The **equipped** event fires after an actor has successfully equipped an item. This event is preceded by the [equip](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/equip) event.

```lua
--- @param e equippedEventData
local function equippedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.equipped, equippedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`item`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
