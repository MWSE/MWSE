# calcRepairPrice

This event is called when determining the price of repairing an item. It can be used to override the repair cost.

```lua
--- @param e calcRepairPriceEventData
local function calcRepairPriceCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.calcRepairPrice, calcRepairPriceCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
