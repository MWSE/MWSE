This event fires when a mod config menu has been closed. This event fires whenever a different mod config menu is selected, or whenever the MCM itself is closed.

You can use this event to update your mod whenever its MCM is closed. This event may also be useful if you're trying to make your mod compatible with another mod, as it lets you detect whenever that mod updates its settings.

```lua
--- @param e modConfigClosedEventData
local function modConfigClosedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.modConfigClosed, modConfigClosedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`modName`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `isFavorite` (boolean): *Read-only*. Whether that mod was a favorite.
