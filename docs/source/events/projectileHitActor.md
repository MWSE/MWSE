# projectileHitActor

The projectileHitActor event fires when a projectile collides with an actor.

```lua
--- @param e projectileHitActorEventData
local function projectileHitActorCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.projectileHitActor, projectileHitActorCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
