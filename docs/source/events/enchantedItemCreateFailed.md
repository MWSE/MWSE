# enchantedItemCreateFailed

This event is fired when an enchanted item could not be created.

```lua
--- @param e enchantedItemCreateFailedEventData
local function enchantedItemCreateFailedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.enchantedItemCreateFailed, enchantedItemCreateFailedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
