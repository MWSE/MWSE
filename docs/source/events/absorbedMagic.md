# absorbedMagic

This event is triggered after magic absorption absorbs and cancels a magic effect, and just before magic absorption gives magicka to the target. It can control the amount of magicka restored.

This event occurs once per effect restored, so a multi-effect spell may trigger this multiple times. The default amount restored is equal to the casting cost of the entire spell, which is the vanilla behaviour.

```lua
--- @param e absorbedMagicEventData
local function absorbedMagicCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.absorbedMagic, absorbedMagicCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`target`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
