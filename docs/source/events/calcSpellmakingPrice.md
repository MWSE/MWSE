# calcSpellmakingPrice

This event is called when determining the cost of making a spell. The price can be modified.

```lua
--- @param e calcSpellmakingPriceEventData
local function calcSpellmakingPriceCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.calcSpellmakingPrice, calcSpellmakingPriceCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
