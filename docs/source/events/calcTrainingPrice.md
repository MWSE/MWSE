# calcTrainingPrice

This event is called when determining the cost of training, and can be used to modify the given price.

```lua
--- @param e calcTrainingPriceEventData
local function calcTrainingPriceCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.calcTrainingPrice, calcTrainingPriceCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
