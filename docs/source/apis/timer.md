# timer

The timer library provides helper functions for creating delayed executors.

## Properties

### `timer.active`

Constant to represent a timer that is actively running.

***

### `timer.expired`

Constant to represent a timer that has completed.

***

### `timer.game`

Constant to represent timers that run based on in-world time. Duration measured in game-scale hours.

***

### `timer.paused`

Constant to represent a timer that is paused.

***

### `timer.real`

Constant to represent timers that run in real-time.

***

### `timer.simulate`

Constant to represent timers that run when the game isn't paused. It matches the `simulate` event's timing. If the game is simulating, simulate events and simulate timers progress. Duration is measured in seconds.

***

## Functions

### `timer.delayOneFrame`

Creates a timer that will finish the next frame. It defaults to the next simulation frame.

```lua
local timer = timer.delayOneFrame(callback, type)
```

**Parameters**:

* `callback` (function): The callback function that will execute when the timer expires.
* `type` (number): *Default*: ``timer.simulate``. Type of the timer. This value can be `timer.simulate`, `timer.game` or `timer.real`.

**Returns**:

* `timer` ([mwseTimer](../../types/mwseTimer))

***

### `timer.register`

Registers a named timer with a callback to persist between game sessions. Bear in mind that nothing in MWSE is sandboxed, so all the registered timers are in the global namespace. Consider prefixing your timer with mod name or something else to avoid name collisions. For instance, `iceCreamMod:myTimer`.

```lua
timer.register(name, fn)
```

**Parameters**:

* `name` (string): Name of the registered timer.
* `fn` (function): A callback function for the timer.

??? example "Example: Show a Message After 1 Day"

	The timer registered in the example is registered and persistent. That renders starting the timer on every loaded event unnecessary. Its state is saved, and it continues where it stopped after loading a save.

	```lua
	
	local function showMessage()
		tes3.messageBox("One day later...")
	end
	
	timer.register("testExample:OneDayTimer", showMessage)
	
	timer.start({
		type = timer.game,
		persist = true,
		iterations = 1,
		duration = 24,
		callback = "testExample:OneDayTimer" -- Notice that the callback isn't a function, but a custom timer.
	})

	```

***

### `timer.start`

Creates a timer.

```lua
local timer = timer.start({ type = ..., duration = ..., callback = ..., iterations = ..., persist = ..., data = ... })
```

**Parameters**:

* `params` (table)
	* `type` (number): *Default*: ``timer.simulate``. Type of the timer. This value can be `timer.simulate`, `timer.game` or `timer.real`.
	* `duration` (number): Duration of the timer. The method of time passing depends on the timer type.
	* `callback` (function): The callback function that will execute when the timer expires.
	* `iterations` (number): *Default*: `1`. The number of iterations to run. Use `-1` for infinite looping.
	* `persist` (boolean): *Default*: `true`. Registering a timer with persist flag set to `true` will serialize the callback string in the save to persist between sessions. Only a registered timer will persist between sessions. See `timer.register()`.
	* `data` (table): *Optional*. Data to be attached to the timer. If this is a persistent timer, the data must be json-serializable, matching the same limitations as data stored on references.

**Returns**:

* `timer` ([mwseTimer](../../types/mwseTimer))

??? example "Example: Show a Countdown Message"

	In this example, whenever the player activates an item they will be shown a 10 second countdown. Because it is a simulation timer, it will not tick down while the menu is open, nor is it sensitive to the game timescale/clock.

	```lua
	local timeLeft = 0;
	
	local function onTimerExpired() 
		timeLeft = timeLeft - 1
		tes3.messageBox("%d seconds left", timeLeft)
	end
	
	local function onActivate(eventData)
		if (eventData.activator == tes3.player) then
			timeLeft = 10
			timer.start{ duration = 1, iterations = 10, type = timer.simulate, callback = onTimerExpired }
		end
	end
	event.register(tes3.event.activate, onActivate)

	```
