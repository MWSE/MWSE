# niSkinDataBoneData

This class contains all the information needed to deform vertices by a single bone.

## Properties

### `bounds`

This bounding volume is used internally by the skinning system to calculate bounding volumes for skinned objects without actually having to calculate the positions of the vertices in the skinned object.

**Returns**:

* `result` (niBound)

***

### `rotation`

Defines the rotation of the bone in the bind pose from the skinned object's coordinate system to the bone's coordinate system.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3matrix33](../../types/tes3matrix33))

***

### `scale`

Defines the scale of the bone in the bind pose from the skinned object's coordinate system to the bone's coordinate system.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `translation`

Defines the translation of the bone in bind pose from the skinned object's coordinate system to the bone's coordinate system.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3vector3](../../types/tes3vector3))

***

### `weights`

*Read-only*. Contains all the per-vertex weight coefficients used when deforming the verticies influenced by this bone.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niSkinDataBoneDataVertexWeight](../../types/niSkinDataBoneDataVertexWeight)[])
