***

### `lineNumber`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">linenumber</div>

The linenumber that triggered this record to be created.

* `result` (integer, false)

***

### `stackLevel`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">stacklevel</div>

The stack level offset at the time of record creation. This information can be used when calling `debug.getinfo` in custom formatters.

***
