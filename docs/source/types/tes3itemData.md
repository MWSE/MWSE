# tes3itemData

A set of variables that differentiates one item from another.

## Properties

### `charge`

The charge of the item. Provides incorrect values on misc items, which instead have a soul actor.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `condition`

The condition/health of the item. Provides incorrect values on light items, which instead have a `timeLeft` property.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `context`

Returns an ease of use script context for variable access.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3scriptContext](../../types/tes3scriptContext))

***

### `count`

The total number of identical items represented by this data. Reserved for use by in-world references. It should always be `1` for items in inventories. Inventories utilize the stack count in [`tes3itemStack`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3itemStack/) object.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `data`

A generic lua table that data can be written to, and synced to/from the save. All information stored must be valid for serialization to json. For data that doesn't persist, use `tempData`.

***

### `owner`

The owner of the associated item. An item can have an owner or it can be faction-owned.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3npc](../../types/tes3npc), [tes3faction](../../types/tes3faction), nil)

***

### `requirement`

A requirement, typically associated with ownership and when the player may freely interact with an object. The type depends on the owner. Faction owners provide a required rank as a number, while NPCs provide a global variable to check.
