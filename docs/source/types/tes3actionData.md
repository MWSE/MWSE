# tes3actionData

A substructure of mobile actors that provides information about the current or previous action.

## Properties

### `aiBehaviorState`

The behavior state of the [tes3actionData](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3actionData). This maps to values in [`tes3.aiBehaviorState`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ai-behavior-states/) namespace.

Value | Behavior
----- | ---------
-1	| Undecided
0	 | Hello
2	 | Idle
3	 | Attack
4	 | Avoid
6	 | Flee
8	 | Walk
12	| Greet

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `animationAttackState`

The actor's animation state. Maps to values in [`tes3.animationState`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-states/) namespace.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `attackSwing`

When attacking, this value represents how much the weapon has been pulled back. The value ranges from [0.0 - 1.0].

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `currentAnimationGroup`

Actor's current animation group. Maps to values in [`tes3.animationGroup`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/animation-groups/) namespace.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `hitTarget`

The actor's attack target. The target will be saved in `hitTarget` field until a new attack is made.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor))

***

### `lastBarterHoursPassed`

No description yet available.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `nockedProjectile`

The currently nocked projectile the associated actor is using. It is available while charging a projectile attack, before releasing the projectile. This can be modified, but can only be set to nil, which will remove the projectile without consuming ammo.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileProjectile](../../types/tes3mobileProjectile))

***

### `physicalAttackType`

A number from the [`tes3.physicalAttackType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/physical-attack-types/) enumeration identifying the physical attack type. Can be `tes3.physicalAttackType.slash`, `.chop`, `.thrust`, `.projectile`, `.creature1`, `.creature2`, or `.creature3.`

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `physicalDamage`

When attacking, this is the value of the weapon damage that was rolled. This value takes into account the actor's strength, attack swing and weapon condition, but it doesn't include difficulty nor target's armor. This value is updated on a attack. After the attack this value will still contain the damage rolled. It will be refreshed on new attack.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `stolenFrom`

No description yet available.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3object](../../types/tes3object))

***

### `target`

The actor's attack target.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor))

***

### `walkDestination`

If moving to a location, this is the position to be walked to.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([tes3vector3](../../types/tes3vector3))
