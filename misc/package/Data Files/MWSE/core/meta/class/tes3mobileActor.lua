Setting this to lower values than the default increases the impact on performance. The default value for a newly created actor depends on the total amount of all currently active [`tes3aiPlanner`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3aiPlanner), meaning the checks will be executed at different intervals for each actor.

When readying a weapon, there is a short period of time at the start of the animation, where the weapon is not visible yet. This flag will only be set after this initial stage is done. This flag is still set with hand-to-hand even though it doesn't use a model. Setting this to false while a weapon is drawn will normally cause the actor to play its weapon draw animation again.
--- @field weaponReady boolean A flag for if the actor has a weapon ready or being readied (visible and held in the hand). Setting it to true will cause the actor to take out their weapon. Setting it to false will cause the actor to put it away.
