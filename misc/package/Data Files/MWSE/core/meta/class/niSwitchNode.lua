--- Represents groups of multiple scene graph subtrees, only one of which is visible at any given time. They are useful for showing different states of a model depending on engine / lua logic. If you detach the active subtree, the switch node will set the active subtree to none, or to an index of -1.
--- @class niSwitchNode : niNode, niAVObject, niObjectNET, niObject
--- @field switchIndex number The value of the active child index. This index represents the index of the active child in the array of the NiSwitchNode. If this index is â€“1, then no child is active.
niSwitchNode = {}
