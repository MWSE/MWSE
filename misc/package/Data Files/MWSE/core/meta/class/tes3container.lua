--- Creates a copy of this object.
--- @param params tes3container.createCopy.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `id`: string? — *Optional*. The new object's ID. If one is not provided, a randomly generated one will be used.
--- 
--- `addToObjectList`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If true, the object will be added to the data handler. If this is false, the new object may not have a randomly generated ID. Do not use this without knowing the implications.
--- 
--- `sourceless`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. If true, the object will be made sourceless, and will not be serialized to the save game. If the object is copied outside of a save game, the object will **always** be sourceless.
--- @return tes3container newObject No description yet available.
