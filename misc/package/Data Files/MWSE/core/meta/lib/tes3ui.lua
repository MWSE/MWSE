--- The tes3ui library provides access to manipulating the game's GUI.
--- @class tes3uilib
tes3ui = {}

--- Sends all text input to the specified element.  Calling this function with a nil argument will release text input and allow keybinds to work. Suppresses most keybinds while active, except the Journal open/close keybind (it's up to the individual menu implementation).
--- 
--- Only one element can have control of input, and there is no automatic restoration of control if one element takes control from another. Be careful of conflicts with other users of this function.
--- @param element tes3uiElement? *Optional*. No description yet available.
function tes3ui.acquireTextInput(element) end

--- When used in a mouse event, causes the element to capture further mouse events even when the cursor goes outside the element. Setting mouse capture should always be accompanied by releasing it on a complementary event. This is commonly used for dragging, so that it can continue even if the mouse moves slightly outside the element.
--- 
--- The capture is always removed when the element is destroyed. The capture may also be removed when the mouse is released, but this is not reliable, as the engine forgets what to do if there is input from any other controller while the mouse is held down.
---
--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uicapturemousedrag).
--- @param capture boolean Turns on mouse capture for the element currently processing a mouse event if true, sending all further mouse events to that element. Turns off capture if false.
function tes3ui.captureMouseDrag(capture) end

--- Creates a simple dialogue choice, as per the `Choice` mwscript function.
--- @param text string The text to display for the choice.
--- @param index number The choice index associated with the given text.
function tes3ui.choice(text, index) end

--- This function closes the book menu.
function tes3ui.closeBookMenu() end

--- Closes the journal menu.
--- @return boolean result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.closeJournal() end

--- This function closes the scroll menu.
function tes3ui.closeScrollMenu() end

--- Creates a help layer menu. Help layer menus include notifications and tooltips that are always above the rest of the interface. The game realizes this using a separate menu root and set of functions.
--- 
--- Note, to create tooltips with the correct behaviour, use tes3ui.createTooltipMenu.
--- 
--- Unlike standard menus, help layer menus are always created with a fixed frame.
--- @param params tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `id`: string|number — The menu’s ID. The menu can be later accessed by tes3ui.findHelpLayerMenu(id).
--- @return tes3uiElement result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu(params) end

---Table parameter definitions for `tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu`.
--- @class tes3ui.createHelpLayerMenu.params
--- @field id string|number The menu’s ID. The menu can be later accessed by tes3ui.findHelpLayerMenu(id).

--- Creates a top-level menu.
--- @param params tes3ui.createMenu.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `id`: string|number — The menu’s ID. The menu can be later accessed by tes3ui.findMenu(id).
--- 
--- `dragFrame`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Constructs a draggable and resizeable frame and background for the menu. It is similar to the stats, inventory, magic and map menus in the standard UI. Its title bar text can be set with the .text property. After construction, position and minimum dimensions should be set.
--- 
--- `fixedFrame`: boolean? — *Default*: `false`. Constructs a fixed (non-draggable) frame and background for the menu. The layout system should automatically centre and size it to fit whatever is added to the menu. This type of menu is modal by default, preventing interaction with other menus while the menu is active.
--- 
--- `modal`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. Only applies to fixedFrame menus. Modal menus prevent interaction with other menus while the menu is active. This behavior can be disabled with this flag.
--- 
--- `loadable`: boolean? — *Default*: `true`. If set to false, calls to loadMenuPosition will fail.
--- @return tes3uiElement result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.createMenu(params) end

--- 
--- `text`: string — The text to display.
--- 
--- `type`: number? — *Optional*. The type for the response. Defaults to `choice` responses.

--- @field index number? *Optional*. The answer index for the response. Only used for `choice` responses.

--- Creates a tooltip menu, which can be an empty menu, an item tooltip, or a spell tooltip. This should be called from within a tooltip event callback. These automatically follow the mouse cursor, and are also destroyed automatically when the mouse leaves the originating element. Creating an item tooltip will invoke the uiObjectTooltip event.
---
--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uicreatetooltipmenu).
--- @param params tes3ui.createTooltipMenu.params? This table accepts the following values:

--- Forces the game to update the inventory tile GUI elements. Unlike tes3ui.updateInventoryTiles, this will force-resync the player's inventory to the GUI, rather than updating what is already in the GUI system.
function tes3ui.forcePlayerInventoryUpdate() end

--- Gets the reference currently selected by the console, or nil if nothing is selected.
--- @return tes3reference|nil result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.getConsoleReference() end

--- Determines what sort of search is being done when performing an inventory selection, e.g. "alembic" or "ingredient" or "soulGemFilled".

function tes3ui.getServiceActor() end

--- Returns the UI scale, set in MGE.
--- @return number scale The UI scale value set from MGE.
function tes3ui.getViewportScale() end

--- Returns both the viewport width and the viewport height. Note that this value is not necessarily the real resolution of the screen. For that value, see the [`same-named function`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3getviewportsize) in the tes3 namespace. To get the scale used, check `getViewportScale`.
--- @return number width The scaled width of the viewport.
--- @return number height The scaled height of the viewport.
function tes3ui.getViewportSize() end

--- Requests menu mode be deactivated on a menu with a given id.
--- @return boolean result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.leaveMenuMode() end

--- Logs a message to the console. The message accepts formatting and additional parameters matching string.format's usage.
---
--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uilog).
--- @param message string No description yet available.
--- @vararg any *Optional*. No description yet available.
function tes3ui.log(message, ...) end

--- Logs a message to the console. Consider using `tes3ui.log` instead of this function if you do not need to make use of the `isCommand` parameter.
---
--- [Examples available in online documentation](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3ui/#tes3uilogtoconsole).
--- @param text string No description yet available.
--- @param isCommand boolean? *Default*: `false`. Passing `true` will make the text in the console selectable by using up arrow key. If it is a valid command, then pressing enter will call it.
function tes3ui.logToConsole(text, isCommand) end

--- 
--- @param unknown nil No description yet available.
--- @return string executed No description yet available.
function tes3ui.lookupID(unknown) end

--- Checks if the game is in menu mode.
--- @return boolean result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.menuMode() end

--- Brings a menu forward to be the top-most menu, firing any associated front-related events. The desired element must be a top-level menu.
--- @param menu string|number|tes3uiElement The menu to bring to the front.
function tes3ui.moveMenuToFront(menu) end

--- Causes the tooltip to be redisplayed. This will not use a configured delay. This will not function if the help menu does not currently exist, or if it is not currently visible.
function tes3ui.refreshTooltip() end

--- Registers a UI element name, returning a UI_ID. Once a property is registered, this function always returns the same UI_ID. These UI_IDs are used by the API to locate elements that may not exist (a weak reference), instead of by element name.
--- 
--- The registry namespace is shared between Property and UI_ID. It is advisable to use a namespace prefix to avoid collisions with other mods.
--- @param s string No description yet available.
--- @return number result No description yet available.
function tes3ui.registerID(s) end

--- Registers a property name, returning a Property. Once a property is registered, this function always returns the same Property.

--- Sets the reference currently selected by the console, or deselects if passed `nil`.
--- @param reference tes3reference|nil No description yet available.
function tes3ui.setConsoleReference(reference) end

--- Displays the book menu with arbitrary text. Paging is automatically handled. It needs to follow book text conventions as in the Construction Set. In essence, it uses HTML syntax. Important: every book needs to end with a `<BR>` statement to be displayed properly. See [`bookGetText`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/bookGetText/#examples) for an example of properly formatted book text.
--- @param text string No description yet available.
function tes3ui.showBookMenu(text) end

--- @field answerIndex number? *Default*: `0`. 

--- This function opens the inventory select menu which lets the player select items from an inventory. These items can be selected from any actor's inventory and can be filtered with the `filter` callback. The selected item can be retrieved in the function assigned to `callback`.
--- @param params tes3ui.showInventorySelectMenu.params This table accepts the following values:
--- 
--- `reference`: tes3reference? — *Default*: `tes3player`. The reference of a `tes3actor` whose inventory will be used.
--- 
--- `title`: string — The text used for the title of the inventory select menu.
--- 
--- `leaveMenuMode`: boolean? — *Optional*. Determines if menu mode should be exited after closing the inventory select menu. By default, it will be in the state it was in before this function was called.
--- 
--- `noResultsText`: string? — *Optional*. The text used for the message that gets shown to the player if no items have been found in the inventory. The default text is equivalent to the `sInventorySelectNoItems` GMST value, unless `"ingredients"` or `"soulgemFilled"` has been assigned to `filter`, in which case the default text is equivalent to either the `sInventorySelectNoIngredients` or `sInventorySelectNoSoul` GMST value respectively.
--- 
--- `noResultsCallback`: function? — *Optional*. A function which is called when no items have been found in the inventory, right before the message containing `noResultsText` is shown.
--- 
--- `filter`: function|string|nil — *Optional*. This determines which items should be shown in the inventory select menu. Accepts either a string or a function.
