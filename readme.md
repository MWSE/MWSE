# Morrowind Script Extender

The nightly MWSE release is now installed by default[^1] with [MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102).

[^1]: If you have downloaded the archive file of MGE XE, you will need to manually run MWSE-Update.exe to install nightly MWSE.

To update MWSE at any time, you may run MWSE-Update.exe and it will update to the latest nightly build.

For mod authors, the best way to learn MWSE and get assistance is to ask questions in the #mwse channel of the [Morrowind Modding Community Discord](https://discord.gg/nTF2PZR).
